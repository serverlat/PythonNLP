# TDT4310 Project - Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP)

This folder contains two important Python classes: LCPR_G and LCPR_I. LCPR_G was used as the final model, while LCPR_I was used in development and is included because it is part of the report. The models.py class is the InferSent model and the wiki_top10.csv is the top 10k word frequency list from Wikipedia. The GloVe and InferSent embeddings, as well as the pickled models for a demo can be found and downloaded here: https://studntnu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/olgasa_ntnu_no/Epd-jaduX4lFqVgwhQhNWl8BRr93rUHc7ULAmwUvWe9pCg?e=9GGQU4. In order to use run the demo, the pickled files (.sav) must be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the model.
