# TDT4310 Project - Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP)

This folder is structured as follow:
- Two model versions: LCPR_G.py and LCPR_I.py. LCPR_G was used as the final model, while LCPR_I was used in development and is included because it is part of the report. 
- InferSent model: models.py (available from https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent) 
- Wikipedia top 10k frequency list: wiki_top10.csv (made from this data https://github.com/IlyaSemenov/wikipedia-word-frequency) 
- CompLex corpus (available from https://github.com/MMU-TDMLab/CompLex)

The GloVe and InferSent embeddings, as well as the pickled models for a demo can be found and downloaded here: https://studntnu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/olgasa_ntnu_no/Epd-jaduX4lFqVgwhQhNWl8BRr93rUHc7ULAmwUvWe9pCg?e=9GGQU4. In order to use run the demo, the pickled files (.sav) must be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the model.
