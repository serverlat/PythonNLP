VIEWERS DESIRE EIJAZ@fakemegfox @silverface_ @itsdivyag @Sababylon My best guess is that he kinda worked as a martyr wanting to inspire others to stand up and give food to the ones that needs it more instead of throwing it out, this way people can be more sneaky and smuggle out food that would normally get thrown away and give to the poor.Part 1 ✅

Shops remain open during lockdowns anyway. It’s the fear from the media driving the panic among consumers. The hysteria is astonishing.@lalovestrump Why people don’t hit their own pause button in their thinking &amp; critically analyse what’s being fed to them information-wise, is beyond me. It’s a choice whether to consume the junk food ideas. Many seem too lazy to think. Which is irresponsible. Self respect is a big issue here.@ZombeiKid @ohmeelo @itsdivyag I agree this too.. donate money to an organisation is better way. if YOU are an organisation that deal with poor people, you should buy vege, chicken, fish, potatoes, instead of canned food and instant noodles.Food Wars is so dope bro.
